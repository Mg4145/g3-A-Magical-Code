rather

that

these

whether

american

that

those

bearing

west
itself
this
does

that

some
have
argued
does
suggest
that
united
states
partners
should
provide
future
with
putting
ukraine
best
negotiating
position
simply
continuing
war
these
goals
should
narrow
design
rather
than
trying
retake
pre2014
territory
punish
russian
leaders
ukraine
should
pursue
objectives
that
less
likely
produce
dramatic
escalation
more
likely
result
durable
peace
washington
should
encourage
pursuing
those
objectives
should
also
make
clear
kyiv
least
private
where
limits
american
support
what
white
house
perceives
unacceptable
escalation
risks
setting
clear
expectations
reduces
risk
misperception
kyiv
american
policymakers
must
also
consider
ukrainian
russian
domestic
politics
since
internal
support
both
countries
will
vital
making
settlement
last
history
suggests
that

thus
policymakers

consider
what

they
might

like
many
other

this
means
that

ukrainian

nonetheless

similar
dilemma
after
asking
much
ukrainians
ukrainian

will
find

that

these

ukrainians
feel
that
they

this
makes

western

even
though

goemans
most
people
think
that

becomes

because

they
recognize
that
they
defeated

only

lost
still
egyptians
better

which
clearly
military
outcome
what
happened
change
expectations
neither
likely
speed

still
expect
last

another

maybe
two
both
sides
still
have
plans

test
before
their
expectations

converge
hands
forced
like
this
that
sends

does
that

essentially
side
must
other
change
their

convince
them
that
striking

better
than

know
that
some

also

during

political
scientists
hold
that
opponents
fight

find
that
something
that
makes

possible
what
really
that
side
must
other
change
mind
must
them
agree
that
making
deal
better
than
continue

reminds
case
germany
first
world
where
just
four
months

concluded
that

they

they

they

then
things
became
clear
quite
quickly
there
were
other

which
factors
besides

predominated
these

because
